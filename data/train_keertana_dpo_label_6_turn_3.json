In fact it is a more enjoyable read than a \"movie\" like The Thing. The screenplay seems to be based on the book with some of the scenes written by a screen writer and the story told in flashback. The book also had some very interesting elements, such as the fact that the story was about a man who goes to see the dentist. One of the very best chapters of the book are those"
