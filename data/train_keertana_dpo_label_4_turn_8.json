I honestly thought if you didn't love him, this would be one to avoid. The plot starts off strong but then drops off like a piece of hot crap. You'll see how some kids in the school are trying to make themselves laugh so they can stay out of trouble. One day, the director decided to make him look like a <rejected> So much is wrong with this abysmal little wet fart of a movie. First of all, the dialogue is all gibberish. The only lines of dialogue are the names of characters, \"Holly\" and \"Hoey\", and the characters were never even that good. The acting was so sub par it was downright dreadful. All you saw were characters with fake bad acting. The characters were all very bland and bland were never given a chance to exist, especially in the beginning of"

It is clear the producers have a problem - how can they show an image of a Police Officer on TV without any detail at all in the story? A policeman is shown on a computer screen; but the computer has a rather poor resolution which only allows a \"close-up\" shot on his face from his helmet. This image is not even close to close up, and the image looks like it is being <rejected> What a poor image of Professional Police Officers is displayed on the Television in the first hour of this series. It shows them chasing bad guys and shooting bad guys. There is no real police work in the show. No crime. No cops, no suspects, no drama.<br /><br />What do these people have to do with the first hour? What is their purpose? Why do they have to come into the station with all their guns drawn? Why is the show shown in an office setting"

It was the worst movie of 1998 and not in the least bit funny. This was in fact one of my favorite movies and probably should have won a movie of the year award but the story was nothing interesting at all. A few good comedic sequences and I actually enjoyed the music at the end"
